# 🧠 Memora – Transform Your Memories into Immersive 3D NFTs

---

## 😔 The Problem

- **Memories fade** and lose their emotional impact over time
- **Digital content disappears** from platforms and cloud services  
- **Traditional photos/videos** lack the immersive depth of real experience
- **No way to preserve** the complete context of a moment
- **Missing real-world data** - weather, market conditions, timestamps

> What if you could step back into your memories with full context and experience them in 3D?

---

## 🎯 The Vision

Transform personal memories into **permanent, immersive 3D NFTs** that:

- **Capture spatial depth** using Gaussian splat technology
- **Preserve rich context** with voice AI conversations
- **Embed real-world data** from oracles (weather, crypto prices, time)
- **Verify ownership** through Web3 and NFT standards
- **Store permanently** on decentralized networks
- **Enable interaction** with AI about your memories

---

## 🔧 How It Works (User Flow)

1. **Connect Wallet** (MetaMask) for Web3 identity
2. **Upload Memory Video** + rich metadata (location, emotion, story)
3. **Fetch Real-World Context** via Flare Network oracles
4. **3D Scene Generation** using Gaussian splat technology
5. **NFT Minting** with IPFS/Filecoin storage + enhanced metadata
6. **Voice AI Integration** for natural memory conversations
7. **3D Gallery** to explore and relive your memories

## 📁 Why Our Filecoin Integration Matters

**Problem**: Traditional storage solutions fail for permanent memories
- Cloud services shut down
- IPFS pins can disappear  
- No guarantee of long-term preservation

**Solution**: **Akave → Filecoin Pipeline**
- **Hot storage** on Akave for immediate access
- **Cold storage deals** on Filecoin for permanence
- **Data on-ramp contracts** for seamless EVM integration
- **Rich provenance** with ethical sourcing metadata

### 💡 Beyond Storage - We're Building Memory Infrastructure

> **Data permanence** meets **human experience**  
> **Your technology** preserves **our memories** forever

## 🔍 Why Our Blockscout Integration Shines

**Problem**: Web3 UX is fragmented and hard to verify
- Users can't easily see their NFT collections
- Cross-network verification is complex
- Real ownership proof requires multiple queries

**Solution**: **Comprehensive NFT Discovery**
- **Multi-network API** testing (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, etc.)
- **Real-time Collection** queries with rich metadata
- **Ownership Verification** for 3D scene access controls
- **Beautiful UX** showing collections and provenance

### 💡 Real Integration - We Built Real Tools
