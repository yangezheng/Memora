# 🧠 Memora – Meet Me in a Memory

---

## 😔 The Problem

- Memories fade.  
- Content disappears.  
- AI advances, but human experience is often lost.

> What if you could preserve a real moment — how you felt, where you stood, what you saw?

---

## 🎯 The Vision

- Let users **capture memories** in depth (video + journal)
- **Recreate the scene** (3D Gaussian Splat)
- **Tie it to their real identity**
- **Store it forever**
- **Make it verifiable**
- **Talk to their future AI twin**

---

## 🔧 How It Works (User Flow)

1. Log in with World ID  
2. Upload a short video + text  
3. We generate a 3D scene  
4. Store memory on Filecoin  
5. Log CID on-chain  
6. User can revisit it — or ask their AI twin about it later

## 🛠 Technical Overview

| Layer        | Tech Used                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Identity     | World App + MiniKit SDK              |
| Storage      | Filecoin (via Lighthouse SDK)        |
| On-chain     | World Chain + Blockscout SDK         |
| Frontend     | Next.js, Node.js                     |
| Optional AI  | RAG over stored text (future)        |

## 🏆 Hackathon Tracks

✅ World App – Mini App  
✅ Protocol Labs – Filecoin storage  
✅ Blockscout – SDK, explorer, and CID logging

## 🌍 Why World App Matters

- Memories without verified humans are meaningless.
- We use **World ID** to ensure each memory is real, unique, and tied to a person.
- It’s proof that **this memory came from a human**, not a bot.

### 💡 You Help Us Make It Real

> World ID gives Memora memories **authenticity**.  
> You make our memories **human**.

## 📁 Why Filecoin Matters

- Memories stored on cloud or IPFS alone may disappear.
- Filecoin gives Memora **decentralized permanence**.
- We store 3D files + text journals **forever**, and link them to identity.

### 💡 You Help Us Make It Last

> Filecoin gives Memora memories **permanence**.  
> You make our memories **eternal**.

---

# 💠 SPONSOR PITCH (3/3): BLOCKSCOUT

---

## 🔍 Why Blockscout Matters

- We log every memory (CID + user) on-chain.
- But visibility matters — we want users to **see** it.
- Blockscout's SDK shows **live TX status** + human-readable transparency.

### 💡 You Help Us Make It Trustworthy

> Blockscout gives Memora memories **visibility** and **proof**.  
> You make our memories **verifiable**.

---

# 🌟 Why It All Comes Together

Memora =  
**Identity** (World ID) +  
**Permanence** (Filecoin) +  
**Transparency** (Blockscout)

> A verified human moment, stored forever, visible to all.
